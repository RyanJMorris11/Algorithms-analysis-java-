The input format must have a header of "Input *" in order to recognize the info.

There are 3 ways to use the input.txt:
	1. It will accept an input.txt absolute path via command prompt

	2. Otherwise it will look for the file in the current directory

	3. By default it will use the hard coded "final static String abolsolutePathForInputFile" if the file isn't found
